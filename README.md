# The project is in development

`slate-devtools` as name suggests it is devtool for [slatejs](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) which will assist you in debugging the code

To know about features take loot at this [issue](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/issues/4112)

# Features

Currently working on finishing these tasks
- [X] Provide some feedback on current state in `RenderHistory` 
- [ ] Differentiate between operations happened in devtools and operations happened in app
- [ ] Update the working of `AppOperations` so that every single of batch of operations will not be considered as single operation
- [ ] Add a cleanup function so that unnecessary operations in `RenderHistory` will not be shown
- [ ] Create a plugin that can be used in creating the app `editor`. It should give a lot more important information about app operations like weather an operation is due to normalization.


# Roadmap

- [X] Release the tool in npm
- [ ] Features
- [ ] Improve the look
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Add support for multiple editors
